# Run N Jump
## Abstract
The Arcade has been called the grandfather of modern video-gaming. The influence of arcade games can be seen even on modern games. The video-game market has been growing rapidly and is projected to continue growing. This had encouraged me to recreate the classic side-scrolling Super Mario Bros experience with my own twist on the formula. 
 
My project goals have been to create a Mario game with light RPG-elements such as friendly NPCs, a text-based story narrative and a basic inventory system. My focus has been on having a working game with collisions, enemy AI agents and other dynamic world features such as unlockable doors. I aim to have it be playable on Windows and Android platforms. For Android I intend to have the game published on the Android Google app store in the future. To create this game, I had utilised mainly the LibGDX Java game development framework based on OpenGL using the Android Studio IDE. I had used TMX tiled maps for the creation of my game levels. Furthermore, I intend to add an online SQL based high-score system for the game to allow the players to compare their score to others.  Additionally, I had added a wide range of animations and SFX into the game to give the game a more professional feel to it.
