Jack@Oh its you again Player!
Jack@Its a welcome surprise.
Player@Hey, what are you doing here?
Jack@I followed a suspicious looking man here.
Player@So you're a stalker?
Jack@No no! You misunderstand.
Jack@I saw him on a police wanted list.
Jack@This guy is a bandit leader.
Player@Maybe we should call the police and leave this place?
Jack@He seemed to be in a hurry, I think they'll get away if we leave them be.
Jack@You must help me get rid of them.
Jack@You go in guns blazing and wipe out at least 5 bandits and I will wait here for the rest.
Player@Aren't you too old to be fighting?
Jack@I am actually a martial artist, and I'm pretty sure I could get rid of the ones that escape you.
Jack@I'll ambush them. I should be fine, I'm more worried for you.
Player@Why? I'm a pro.
Jack@You don't look like much of a fighter, I'll give you a few tips.
Jack@Firstly, don't fight them head on, instead jump on top of a bandit from surprise.
Jack@Secondly, try to pick off stragglers and not get surrounded by many bandits at once.
Jack@Thirdly, it will be easiest if you arm yourself with with a weapon, i'm sure you can find one in their lair.
Jack@Lastly, I fought one of them before and they seem to use the same sort of primitive weaponry.
Player@What do you mean?
Jack@These guys are really into role-playing they armed themselves in medieval armour and wield swords. Despite having access to guns.
Jack@Their swords are heavy so once a bandit swings at you, you should have a moment to tackle them while the bandit gathers energy for another swing.
Player@I'll keep that in mind.
